When designing this chatbot for the e-commerce store, my primary goal was to create a flexible and configurable system that can adapt to different customer inquiries and responses, while allowing the store owner to control the conversation flow.

### Thought Process

#### 1. **Conversation Flow Design**
The chatbot's purpose is to guide users through a conversational experience where they can inquire about products, order status, or FAQs. Since different customers may have varying needs, I envisioned the conversation as a tree structure. Each node in this tree represents a point in the conversation, with multiple possible next steps based on user input.

For example, the conversation starts at a "welcome" node, where the customer is presented with multiple options (product recommendations, order status, FAQs). Depending on their choice, the conversation moves to the appropriate next node, like asking what type of product they are interested in.

I designed a conversation tree using nodes, where each node can have:
- A message for the customer
- A set of possible options they can choose from (in case of multiple-choice nodes)
- Conditional next steps based on their response.

#### 2. **Configurability for Store Owners**
One of the key goals was to allow store owners to configure the conversation tree without needing to change the code. I used a simple `ConversationTree` structure (which can be represented as JSON) that the store owner can modify. This gives flexibility to adapt the chatbot's flow based on the store's needs (e.g., updating product categories or FAQs). The store owner can update the conversation tree via a simple REST API, making it highly configurable.

#### 3. **State Management**
The chatbot needs to remember the conversation state with each customer to avoid repeating questions or losing context. I wanted the chatbot to handle multiple concurrent users, so I introduced a unique customer ID that is stored in the browser's local storage. This allows us to identify each user and persist their conversation state even if they refresh the page or return later.

I made sure that each customer's state is maintained on the backend using a `ConversationManager`. This component keeps track of the current node in the conversation for each customer, so we can dynamically adapt the conversation based on their input.

#### 4. **Handling Different Input Types**
In addition to simple text responses, I anticipated that the chatbot would need to handle multiple-choice questions. Each conversation node can have a `type` property (`text` or `multiple_choice`), and if it's multiple choice, I set up options for the customer to select from. This ensures the bot can handle various input scenarios based on the customer's selection, dynamically moving to the next appropriate node.

For instance, if a customer asks for product recommendations, the bot will offer categories like "Electronics" or "Clothing," and the conversation will adapt based on their choice.

#### 5. **API Design**
The API is designed to handle three main actions:
- **Start a conversation** (`/api/chat/start`): This initializes the conversation for a customer and returns the first node.
- **Process customer response** (`/api/chat/response`): When the customer replies, the backend processes the response and returns the next node in the conversation tree.
- **Restart the conversation** (`/api/chat/restart`): If needed, customers can restart the conversation, and the bot will guide them from the beginning.

Additionally, I implemented an API for updating the conversation tree (`/api/config/tree`), giving the store owner control over the conversation flow without needing developer intervention.

#### 6. **Error Handling and End Nodes**
Finally, I accounted for potential dead ends or final points in the conversation. Each node can have an `isEndNode` property to signify the end of the flow, like when a customer has reached the final response. In case a customer provides unexpected input, the bot can default to a safe fallback or prompt the user to choose an option again.

### Conclusion
In summary, my thought process was centered around building a configurable, state-aware chatbot that can guide customers through an intuitive conversation, while allowing the store owner to have full control over the conversation flow. The system's flexibility, state management, and ability to handle multiple conversation paths ensure that it can provide a personalized experience for every customer interaction.
